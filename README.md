Sentiment Analysis of National Anthem lyrics

This project is intended to perform a sentiment analysis of the lyrics of National Anthems of different countries.  
I am doing this as a programming exercise and purely for my own amusement.
The trigger for doing this stems from an ANZAC day service I attended where we sang the Australian anthem 
(Advance Australia Fair) along with the New Zealand one (God Defend New Zealand), and I got to musing
about the sentiments expressed in the two anthems.  This was further heighted when I stopped to think 
about the likes of the rather more war like US anthem (The Star Spangled Banner) or the downright bloodthirsty 
French one (La marseillaise) and I thought it would be amusing to do a compare-and-contrast.

In this analysis I will be looking at the English translations of as many national anthems as I can find. 
I will need to source the anthem lyrics and read them into the analysis package, perform a sentiment analysis,
and then present the findings.  Possible things to look at are:

* Which country has the most positive anthem? The most negative?
* Does sentiment vary by region or continent?
* Does sentiment vary by age of the anthem?
* Are there differences between the first and later verses?

The source of lyrics I will be using is this web site:
